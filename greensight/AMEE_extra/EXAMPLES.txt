There are currently two examples:

1. examples/plane.php

A simple example which shows how to calculated the CO2 generated by a flight
from London (LGW) to LA (LAX).

2. tests/integration/AMEE/ExampleTest.php

An example which acts as both PHPUnit integration test for the library as well
as a documented example of how the AMEE REST API PEAR library can be used.

3. tests/integration/AMEE/MARVTest.php

A similar example to the tests/integration/AMEE/ExampleTest.php example, which
also acts as both PHPUnit integration test for the library as well as a
documented example of how the AMEE REST API PEAR library can be used; this test
specifically covers the use of Multiple Algorithm Return Values.
