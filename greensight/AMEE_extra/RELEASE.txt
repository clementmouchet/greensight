AMEE REST API PEAR Library Release History
------------------------------------------

Current Version:

v1.3.0

- Released on: 2011-03-10
- Removed the inclusion of the PHPUnit/Framework.php file from the unit and
    integration tests, as this is deprecated in newer versions of PHPUnit.
- Moved the example unit & integration test file to a more sensible location.
- Updated the unit test suite to only use date/time strings that are in the UTC
    timezone, as this is what the AMEE API always uses for created/modified
    date/time strings.
- Updated the library to extract and use the timezone specified in the ISO 8601
    formatted date/time strings returned from the AMEE API when ensuring that
    all dates are correctly formatted, instead of the local timezone.
- Updated all PHP files to include library version information in doc blocks.
- Added support for debugging the API calls made, including obtaining timing
    information on those API calls.
